# MouserateFramerate

A Minecraft mod which limits game framerate if configurable activities have ceased for a configurable amount of time. These activities includes voluntary movement, being hurt, using most items/swinging fists, or moving your mouse within the screen.

The 1.17 jar is compatible with both 1.17 and 1.18; the 1.19 jar requires the Cloth Config API and Modmenu to alter its settings.
